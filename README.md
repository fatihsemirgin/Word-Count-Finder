### You should consider only English language books from Gutenberg Project (https://dev.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top) as your input for this project because the evaluation of your homework will be conducted with randomly selected English books from this source.
### First is “stop_words_english.txt” that contains the stop words of English language that you are required to remove from your text. It was downloaded from this website (https://countwordsfree.com/stopwords).
### Second is “book_1.txt” that contains “Moby Dick; Or, The Whale by Herman Melville” book that has been downloaded from (https://dev.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701).
### Third is “book_2.txt” that contains “A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens” book that has been downloaded from (https://dev.gutenberg.org/ebooks/98). Even though these books are given to you as examples, your code should work correctly for other books in Gutenberg Project website. Your code will be graded using other randomly selected books from this website (https://dev.gutenberg.org/).
### Lastly, you should try to lowercase all words to prevent your program to consider them different from one another. You should also remove or delete punctuation marks present in the text (e.g. ?, !, :, etc.), to focus on words alone. You should consider only punctuation marks that are present in ASCII and Extended ASCII table in the following website (https://www.ascii-code.com/)
